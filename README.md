# Hello World And Welcome to The Borderless Tourist

This is a project I completed using Python3. The idea is to help the user recommend places of interest depending on where the user is.

In the future, I would like to design an app around this code and make something easy to use and workable on my anyones phone. 
This is purely for practice. All the logic code is completed and at its current state it works and have been tested.
