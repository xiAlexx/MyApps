# Hello World And Welcome to The Borderless Tourist

This is a project I completed using Python3. The code helps users find places of interests that the user finds interesting in locations they are in.
For example if the person is in china and likes gardens it should recommend the Yu garden and not the great wall of china etc.

In the future, I would like to design an app around this code and make something easy to use and workable on any phone. 
This is purely for practice. All the logic code is completed and at its current state it works and have been tested.

If anyone see's this and would like to help please feel free to contact me and I'd be happy to work together.

Thank you for reading this.

kind regards 

Alex
